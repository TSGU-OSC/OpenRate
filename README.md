[Chinese](./README_ZH.md) 

## üì¢  Project Introduction

OpenRate is a software built on Python script crawlers to analyze information, and Java code is used to persistently fetch information to MySQL. This software can evaluate the contribution of submissions by calculating metrics such as the complexity of modified code functions, the number of modified code lines, and the level of modified folders
This project has the following main functions:
1. Function complexity evaluation: Evaluate the complexity of the submitted function through static analysis of the code.
2. Line of code statistics: Calculate the number of lines of code modified in each submission or PR.
3. Folder level analysis: Evaluate the difficulty of code changes based on the directory structure where the files are located.
4. Submission workload rating: Taking into account multiple indicators, calculate a workload rating for each submission.
5. Visualization of Open Source Project Contributions: Provides a comprehensive evaluation of the contribution of open source projects, helping developers and project maintainers make decisions.
